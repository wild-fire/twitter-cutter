## Paper

## Contents

Dataset are 214 text files with tweets corresponding to one unique day.

Text files have the following structure:

```
[date(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)]\t[user_nickname] ([user_name])\t[tweet]\t[tweet_link]
```

We have not found any tweet splitted on two lines, so we don't need any preprocessing.

## Date ranges

2009/01/26 - 2009/08/31 (excluding 2009/04/26 and 2009/08/22-24)
