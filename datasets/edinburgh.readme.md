"The Edinburgh Twitter Corpus" by Petrovic, S. and Osborne, M. and Lavrenko, V.

## Contents

Dataset is one large file with the following structure:

```
[date(YYYYMMDDHHmmss)][fake_user_id]\t[tweet]\t[client]
```

We have not found any tweet splitted on two lines, so we don't need any preprocessing.

## Date ranges

2009/11/10 - ?? (ordered from oldest to newest)
