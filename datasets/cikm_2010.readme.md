"You are where you tweet: a content-based approach to geo-locating twitter users" by Cheng, Zhiyuan and Caverlee, James and Lee, Kyumin

## Contents

Dataset are two files with tweets (test_set_tweets.txt and training_set_tweets.txt) and users (test_set_users.txt and training_set_users.txt).

Tweet files have the following structure:

[user_id]\t[tweet_id]\t[tweet]\t[date(YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss)]

'test_set_tweets.txt' file contains 5.156.047 lines and 'training_set_tweets.txt' contains 3.845.622 lines. Whole dataset contains 9.001.669 lines.

Some tweets may have \n so they are splitted in lines:

  60730027  6278292609  FREEDOM OF CHOICE. THAT IS ALL.

Because of this we may have to do some preprocessing on the file, stripping those end of lines that are not preceded by a date (also we could split accidentally a tweet which has a date inside and happens to be splitted before the preprocessing)
